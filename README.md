## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  A Google Account (to use Google Sheets and Apps Script).
2.  A Canvas LMS account with appropriate permissions to create quizzes and generate API Access Tokens.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Make a Copy of the Google Sheet:**
    *   Open this [GOOGLE SHEET TEMPLATE (VIEW ONLY)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRXJ_Ei8BUdyw2S9E31uS_CtCJ58d1yxh3RnYdp6hQY/edit?usp=sharing).
    *   Go to **File > Make a copy**. Name your copy and save it to your Google Drive.
2.  **Open the Apps Script Editor:**
    *   In your copied Google Sheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**. This will open the script editor.
3.  **Review Configuration Sheets:**
    *   Open the "Instructions" tab in your copied Google Sheet for a detailed guide on setting up:
        *   **Your Question Bank Sheets** (e.g., `TF`, `MC`, `ES`)
        *   `SelectQuestions_Config`
        *   `CanvasQuiz_Config`
4.  **Initial Run & Authorization:**
    *   The first time you run any function from the "Extra Menu" (e.g., "Select Questions"), Google will ask for authorization.
    *   Review the permissions carefully and grant them.
5.  **Canvas API Token:**
    *   The first time you run "Create Quiz on Canvas", if a `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` is not found, you will be prompted to enter it.
    *   This token will be stored in Script Properties for future use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once set up, use the "Extra Menu" in your Google Sheet:

1.  **Select Questions:**
    *   Configure the `SelectQuestions_Config` sheet.
    *   Run **Extra Menu > Select Questions**.
    *   The `Selected Questions` sheet will be populated.
2.  **Create Quiz on Canvas:**
    *   Ensure the `Selected Questions` sheet (or the sheet specified in `CanvasQuiz_Config`) has the questions you want.
    *   Configure the `CanvasQuiz_Config` sheet with your Canvas URL, Course ID, quiz title, and points.
    *   Run **Extra Menu > Create Quiz on Canvas**.
    *   A summary will appear. The quiz will be created as **UNPUBLISHED** in your Canvas course.

## üìÇ Code Structure

The Apps Script project is organized into the following main files/modules:

*   **`CreateCanvasQuiz.gs`:** Contains the main `onOpen` function, global constants, and the `QuestionShuffler`, and `CanvasQuizCreator` modules/objects.
    *   `QuestionShuffler`: Handles the logic for selecting questions.
    *   `CanvasQuizCreator`: Handles the logic for creating quizzes on Canvas.
*   **`UiUtils.gs`:** Contains helper functions for displaying toast messages and dialogs (if you implemented this).
