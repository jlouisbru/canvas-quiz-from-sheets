# Create Canvas Quiz From Google Sheets

This Google Apps Script project streamlines the process of selecting questions from various banks within a Google Sheet, and then uploading those selected questions to create quizzes directly in Canvas LMS.

## Features

*   **Centralized Question Banks:** Manage True/False, Multiple Choice, and Essay questions in dedicated Google Sheet tabs.
*   **Flexible Question Selection:** Configure rules in `SelectQuestions_Config` to pick questions based on:
    *   Source sheet
    *   Total number of questions
    *   Questions per lecture/topic
    *   Lecture/topic range
    *   Option to mark questions as "Do Not Pick Again" in source sheets.
*   **Automated Canvas Quiz Creation:**
    *   Generates quizzes in Canvas using questions from the `Selected Questions` sheet.
    *   Supports different point values per question type (TF, MC, ES, Default).
    *   Handles True/False, Multiple Choice, Multiple Answers, and Essay question types in Canvas.
    *   Creates quizzes as **UNPUBLISHED**, allowing for review before student access.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    *   Custom menu within Google Sheets for easy operation.
    *   Configuration driven through dedicated sheets (`SelectQuestions_Config`, `CanvasQuiz_Config`).
    *   Progress indicators and completion summaries.
*   **Instruction Sheet:** Includes a detailed "Instructions" tab within the spreadsheet for setup and usage guidance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  A Google Account (to use Google Sheets and Apps Script).
2.  A Canvas LMS account with appropriate permissions to create quizzes and generate API Access Tokens.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Make a Copy of the Google Sheet:**
    *   Open this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRXJ_Ei8BUdyw2S9E31uS_CtCJ58d1yxh3RnYdp6hQY/edit?usp=sharing
    *   Go to **File > Make a copy**. Name your copy and save it to your Google Drive.
2.  **Open the Apps Script Editor:**
    *   In your copied Google Sheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**. This will open the script editor.
3.  **Review Configuration Sheets:**
    *   Open the "Instructions" tab in your copied Google Sheet for a detailed guide on setting up:
        *   **Your Question Bank Sheets** (e.g., `TF`, `MC`, `ES`)
        *   `SelectQuestions_Config`
        *   `CanvasQuiz_Config`
4.  **Initial Run & Authorization:**
    *   The first time you run any function from the "Extra Menu" (e.g., "Select Questions"), Google will ask for authorization.
    *   Review the permissions carefully and grant them if you trust the script (which you should, as it's your copy!).
    *   The script will require permission to:
        *   View and manage your spreadsheets in Google Drive (to read configs and write selected questions).
        *   Connect to an external service (to interact with the Canvas API).
        *   Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars (for UI elements like `toast`).
5.  **Canvas API Token:**
    *   The first time you run "Create Quiz on Canvas", if a `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` is not found in `CanvasQuiz_Config` or Script Properties, you will be prompted to enter it.
    *   This token will be stored in Script Properties for future use (scoped to your user and this script project).
    *   To generate a Canvas API Token: In Canvas, go to Account > Settings > Approved Integrations > "+ New Access Token".

## Usage

Once set up, use the "Extra Menu" in your Google Sheet:

1.  **Select Questions:**
    *   Configure the `SelectQuestions_Config` sheet.
    *   Run **Extra Menu > Select Questions**.
    *   The `Selected Questions` sheet will be populated.
2.  **Create Quiz on Canvas:**
    *   Ensure the `Selected Questions` sheet (or the sheet specified in `CanvasQuiz_Config`) has the questions you want.
    *   Configure the `CanvasQuiz_Config` sheet with your Canvas URL, Course ID, quiz title, and points.
    *   Run **Extra Menu > Create Quiz on Canvas**.
    *   A summary will appear. The quiz will be created as **UNPUBLISHED** in your Canvas course.

## Code Structure

The Apps Script project is organized into the following main files/modules:

*   **`Code.gs` (or your main file name):** Contains the main `onOpen` function, global constants, and the `QuestionShuffler`, and `CanvasQuizCreator` modules/objects.
    *   `QuestionShuffler`: Handles the logic for selecting questions.
    *   `CanvasQuizCreator`: Handles the logic for creating quizzes on Canvas.
*   **`UiUtils.gs` (Optional):** Contains helper functions for displaying toast messages and dialogs (if you implemented this).
